-&lt;p&gt;  It's great to have server to play on that is your own or used by a group
-  of friends, you can have your own local competitions, tournaments etc. Having
-  a server is one thing, getting people to connect to it is another.&lt;br&gt;

-&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Diablo II Open Server &amp; Diablo II Closed Server?&lt;a name=&quot;openorclosed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
-      &lt;blockquote&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; The answer to this question is overall simple.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; 1. A Diablo II Open Server means that your character is not stored on PvPGN 
-  like on the real Battle.net (TM). When you play on Battle.net (TM), your player is 
-  stored on their server. In open Battle.net (TM) game play, your character is 
-  stored on your local computer instead. This requires D2CS &amp; D2DBS to be 
-  running in addition to PvPGN on the server side. It has several advantages &amp; 
-  disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;strong&gt;Advantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
-          * Single player character can be used to play on Battle.net (TM).&lt;br&gt;
-          * Backups can be made of your character in case your character file gets hosed or lost. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

-  charactor data.&lt;br&gt;

+      &lt;p class=&quot;style1&quot;&gt; Thanks to Gambit642 at forums.pvpgn.org for this howto contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
+      &lt;p&gt;This documentation has been written to Windows users with the set up of D2Closed support 
+    for Diablo II &amp; LOD v1.10's&lt;/p&gt;
+      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
+        &lt;br&gt; 
+        &lt;strong&gt;Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+      &lt;p&gt; #1) If you are having trouble with D2GS, don't try to repair your current setup. 
+    Just redownload and start fresh, and save your &quot;charsave&quot; folder to not lose any 
+    charactor data.&lt;br&gt;
+    &lt;br&gt;
+    #2) If this isn't your first time configuring D2GS, and you are going to start 
+    fresh, run &quot;regedit&quot; and navigate to&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE&quot;&lt;br&gt;
   and delete the &quot;D2Server&quot; registry key. If this was imported wrong, it could be 
-  the problem with your server.&lt;br&gt;
-  &lt;br&gt;
-  #3) You may also have problems with your registry for PvPGN services, D2CS &amp; D2DBS. 
-  Run &quot;regedit&quot; and navigate to&lt;br&gt;
+    the problem with your server.&lt;br&gt;
+    &lt;br&gt;
+    #3) You may also have problems with your registry for PvPGN services, D2CS &amp; D2DBS. 
+    Run &quot;regedit&quot; and navigate to&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\&quot;&lt;br&gt;
   and delete the &quot;D2CS&quot; &amp; &quot;D2DBS&quot; registry keys. These need to point to the updated 
-  location of the D2CS and D2DBS EXE's, or they will not launch correctly as services&lt;br&gt;
-  &lt;br&gt;
-  #4) Understand that Diablo II Closed Realm support is created from a combination 
-  of four different servers/services.&lt;/p&gt;
-      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
-      &lt;ul&gt;
-        &lt;li&gt; Player Vs. Player Gaming Network Server (PvPGN)&lt;/li&gt;
-        &lt;li&gt;          Diablo II Game Server (D2GS)&lt;/li&gt;
-        &lt;li&gt;Diablo II DataBase Server (D2DBS)&lt;/li&gt;
-        &lt;li&gt;Diablo II Console Server (D2CS)&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #5) Understand, Diablo II Game Server (D2GS) is only a Windows binary! There is no 
-          Source for this binary, so it has not been converted to other OS platforms. &quot;DRU&quot; 
-          (Divels R' Us), writer of D2GS, is a ghost, and has no known contact information. 
-          If you are hosting PvPGN on a non-Windows machine, you will need either a seprate 
-          Windows PC to run D2GS, or type of Windows emulation, such as Virtual PC for Mac, or 
-          WINE for UNIX.&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #6) Understand that D2Closed.exe is dead! It was the single file which ran the Diablo II 
-          DataBase Server(D2DBS) &amp; Diablo II Console Server(D2CS) services. But fear not, it was 
-          replaced with the two seprate files, D2DBS.exe &amp; D2CS.exe, included in the PvPGN install, &lt;br&gt;
-          which do the same thing, only better.&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #7) It's always best to use your computers REAL IP address, not the universal 
-          loopback (127.0.0.1)&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #8) It is very important to decide whare you want your Executable's and don't move them. 
-          For services to run properly, the applications need to remain in the same location&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #9) If you are using any type of &quot;No CD&quot; cracks, or game loaders, dont be supprized 
-          if you are having trouble. A known issue when not using the original game executable's 
-          is dropping right after a game starts&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-        #10) These instructions are for Windows 2000/2000 Server/XP/2003 Server&lt;/li&gt;
-      &lt;/ul&gt;

-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #1) A already working PvPGN directory (v1.6.3 Recomended) - download here:
-          PvPGN v1.6.3 Win32&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-          #2) Diablo 2 Game Server(D2GS) (Beta 6 Required for Daiblo 2 v1.10) - download here:   
-          D2GS Beta6 Win32 
-          and use WinRAR to extract to a folder in PvPGN directory, called &quot;D2GS&quot;&lt;br&gt;
-          &lt;br&gt;
-        #3) The following files copied into the new PvPGN\D2GS directory&lt;/p&gt;

+    #9) If you are using any type of &quot;No CD&quot; cracks, or game loaders, dont be supprized 
+            if you are having trouble. A known issue when not using the original game executable's 
+            is dropping right after a game starts&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up Diablo II closed realm on Linux/Mac &lt;a name=&quot;unix&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

-      &lt;blockquote&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; How do I setup D2CS &amp; D2DBS on *nix based systems?&lt;br&gt;
-Make sure that PvPGN works ok on it's own before attempting to run D2CS or D2DBS. D2CS will attempt to connect &amp; create a link between it and PvPGN. D2CS will also attempt to connect to D2DBS for the ladder data. This is why it is so important to have PvPGN working before attempting to load D2CS or D2DBS. Also, I'm not sure whether or not D2CS or D2DBS will run under Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; D2CS &amp; D2DBS must both be installed &amp; loaded in order to host a Diablo II Open Server. What's an Open Server? Click here to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; First lets start out on how to setup D2CS. D2CS is the realm server which handles realm requests. Go to the path where you install PvPGN in the etc sub-directory &amp; edit the d2cs.conf file.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; 1. In the d2cs.conf file, look for the &quot;Server Major Settings&quot; section. Scroll down to the realmname, it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * realmname = D2CS&lt;br&gt;
-  This is the realm name D2CS will attempt to use when a user connects. Leave this the way it is for now. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; Now go to the servaddrs field &amp; make it look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * servaddrs = 0.0.0.0:6113&lt;br&gt;
-  This tells D2CS to listen on port 6113, using the TCP protocol, on all IP addresses. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; Scroll down to gameservlist. This field should be commented out by default via a &quot;#&quot;, which tells D2CS to ignore this line. Unless you plan on using D2GS, which will not be discussed in this section, leave this commented out:&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * #gameservlist = your.gameserver&lt;br&gt;
-  This has a hash in front of it by default &amp; really should be left that way unless you plan on running a Diablo II Closed Server. Basically, if you are also running D2GS, you would enable this line &amp; change this to the IP address of your D2GS server, which is not discussed in this section. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; Now for the final setting before we can start D2CS. Scroll down again to bnetdaddr. This field is the IP address PvPGN is running on. D2CS attempts to connect to PvPGN &amp; create a link or route. So that when someone connects with Diablo II, PvPGN will route them to the D2CS daemon. This would typically be the exact same IP address &amp; port of the servaddrs in the bnetd.conf file. For now set it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * bnetdaddr = 0.0.0.0:6112&lt;br&gt;
-  This tells D2CS to initiate it's connection/hand-shaking procedure to any IP address on your system that is listening on the TCP protocol on port 6112. Which would typically be PvPGN assuming you used the instructions for setting up a PvPGN server above. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; The last setting to that should be changed in the d2cs.conf file are the loglevels located in the &quot;Message Logs&quot; section. Scroll down &amp; change loglevels to:&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * loglevels = fatal,error,warn,info,trace,debug&lt;br&gt;
-  This tells D2CS to log all possible errors &amp; trace information so we can see who connects to D2CS. &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; Save &amp; close your text editor. Leave the rest of the settings alone in the d2cs.conf. D2CS should run file without any other changes.&lt;br&gt;
-        &lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; 2. Now at least part of D2CS is configured but their still is another file that must be changed before you can move on to configuring D2DBS. The realm list needs to be configured so D2CS knows what IP address the D2CS realm goes to. Edit the realm.list file, also located in the etc sub-directory.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt; * For starters, make sure the D2CS realm line isn't hashed (#) out. So basically, make sure their no # in front of the D2CS line. This sample illustrates the CORRECT setup.&lt;/p&gt;
-        &lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

+      &lt;p&gt; How do I setup D2CS &amp; D2DBS on *nix based systems?&lt;br&gt;
+        Make sure that PvPGN works ok on it's own before attempting to run D2CS or D2DBS. D2CS will attempt to connect &amp; create a link between it and PvPGN. D2CS will also attempt to connect to D2DBS for the ladder data. This is why it is so important to have PvPGN working before attempting to load D2CS or D2DBS. Also, I'm not sure whether or not D2CS or D2DBS will run under Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
